Literature Review and Software Tooling 
Dataset : MySpeed (Crowdsourced Mobile Data Speeds)
Description: This catalog provides Crowdsourced Mobile Data Speeds and other network information measured using TRAI MySpeed App.It contains the data speed for different region of states for a particular service provider.
Link : https://data.gov.in/resources/all-india-crowdsourced-mobile-data-speed-measurement-august-2021

Observations :
Bar Plot :
	Data_Speed
Service_Provider	
AIRTEL	6253.878922
CELLONE	1901.100486
JIO	18031.227123
Vi India	8828.696609


 
•	We can see that Jio has the best average speed among the others service provider across the nation .
•	The average speed for JIO is 18000 Kbps.
•	The Second best performing provider is Vi India which has a average speed 8828Kbps.
•	The worst performing is Cellone .

Scatter Plot :

•	As we can see from the scatter plot there is no visible linear relationship between the signal strength and data speed .
•	But we can see that for higher signal strength the data speed is much on the higher side of the plot .



Box Plot :  

•	Plotted the box plot between the data speed and service provider .
•	It can be seen that the outliers for airtel and vi are more and the highest speed is achieved by both airtel and jio.
•	The median speed of JIO is the highest among all others and its varied out more then others .
•	Cellone has the least median speed among all others .
